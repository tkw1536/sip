# TIPSY - Tom's Inspector for Pathbuilders <sub>Yaaaaaahs!</sub>

This repository contains TIPSY, an advanced inspector for Pathbuilders produced by the [WissKI](https://wiss-ki.eu) software.
It is a work in progress, and made available for evaluation purposes only.

<b>
While the code to this project is open source and you may inspect it to your heart's content, this repository (currently) does not have a license. 
This means that you may not run, create derivative works of or distribute this code.

In particular you are __not__ granted a license to use this code to create visualizations of your own pathbuilders for publications.

You may only use this tool in non-chromium-based browsers, such as [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) (or Safari if you must).

## User-facing Documentation

User-facing Documentation can be found in-app under the document tab. 
Alternatively, see [inspector.md](macros/docs/inspector.md) and [rdf.md](macros/docs/rdf.md).

## Development

The application is written in Typescript and uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) for dependency management. 
To install all dependencies (including development tools) use:

```bash
yarn install
```

It uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for bundling, [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) for testing, [Eslint](https://eslint.org) for linting (including a [Prettier](https://prettier.io) plugin for formatting). 
See the scripts part in [package.json](package.json) on how each command runs:
```bash
# start a development server
yarn start

# bundle a distribution into the dist/ directory
yarn build

# run typechecking, linting, testing + spellchecking
yarn ci
```

After starting a development server, access the app at `http://localhost:1234/`. 

## Embedding

To embed and directly load a file in tipsy, it is possible to embed tipsy via an iframe and [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) to it.
TIPSY will inform the parent window when it is ready to receive such a message by sending a message with the contents of 'tipsy:ready'.

You can use something like the following to create such an iframe.
```javascript
/**
 * Creates an Iframe with a TIPSY instance at the given url, waits for it to be ready, and then loads the given xml data. 
 * The caller should ensure that the iframe is added to the page and actually contains tipsy.  
 * @param {string} tipsy the url of the TIPSY instance
 * @param {string} filename the filename of the xml to load
 * @param {string} type the media type of the file
 * @param {string} data XML content of pathbuilder to load
 * @returns {HTMLIFrameElement} 
 */
function createTipsyFrame(tipsy, filename, type, data) {
    // create an iframe with the source pointing to tipsy
    const iframe = document.createElement('iframe')
    iframe.setAttribute('src', tipsy)

    // wait for a message from tipsy to tell us that tipsy is ready
    const handleTipsyReady = (/** @type {MessageEvent} */message) => {
        if (message.source !== iframe.contentWindow || message.data !== 'tipsy:ready') {
            return
        }
        message.preventDefault()
    
        window.removeEventListener('message', handleTipsyReady)
        message.source.postMessage({'filename': filename, 'type': type, 'data': data}, '*');
    }
    window.addEventListener('message', handleTipsyReady)

    // and return the iframe
    return iframe
}

// somehow get the filename and xml
const pbName = 'filename.xml';
const pbXML = '<pathbuilderinterface />'; /* full contents omitted */

// create the frame and add it to the body
const frame = createTipsyFrame('http://localhost:1234', pbName, 'application/xml', pbXML)
document.body.append(frame)
```


## Scripts

In addition to the web-interface there are a couple of scripts in the `scripts` folder. 
These can be executed with `vite-node`, for example:

```bash
node node_modules/vite-node/vite-node.mjs ./scripts/render-model-graphviz.ts -p pathbuilder.xml
```

The individual scripts each come with an appropriate `--help` argument for detailed usage.
